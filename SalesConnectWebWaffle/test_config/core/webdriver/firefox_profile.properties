#Properties here are set in webdriver FirefoxProfile. They are set as Keey:Value as corresponds to the settings in firefoxes about:config.
#Values will be automatically cast in the order Boolean, Integer, String. So this can't be used to set a string as a String that will be 
#interpreted as a Boolean ("true" or "false") or will be parsed as an Integer without Exception.
